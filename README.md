Visualization of the task as a game

### Problem:
50. Consider two objects with m1 .
m2 connected by a light string
that passes over a pulley having
a moment of inertia of I about
its axis of rotation as shown in
Figure P10.50. The string does
not slip on the pulley or stretch.
The pulley turns without friction.
The two objects are
released from rest separated by
a vertical distance 2h. (a) Use
the principle of conservation of
energy to find the translational
speeds of the objects as they
pass each other. (b) Find the angular speed of the pulley
at this time.
